\section{Graphs and Terminology}

\begin{definition}
    A \textbf{graph} $G=(V,E)$ consists of a nonempty set of vertices and a set $E$ of edges. Each edge has either one or two vertices associated with it, called its \textit{endpoints}. A \textbf{loop} is an edge between a vertex and itself. A \textbf{multiple edge} is one in which the same pair of vertices is assigned to the more than one edge.
