\section{Introduction to Work}

\begin{definition}{def4.1:label}
    \textbf{WORK: How much energy it takes to do a certain physical action.}

    $$
    W = \Delta E = \vec F \cdot \vec {\Delta x}
    $$

    $W$ = Work done (SI Units: $\J = \N\m$)\\
    $\Delta E$ = Change in energy\\
    $\vec F$ = the force applied\\
    $\Delta x$ = the displacement over which the object was applied the given force $\vec F$
\end{definition}


\begin{problem}
    A couch is pushed with a force 25 $\N$ over a distance of 5 $\m$. Calculate the work that is applied to the couch. 

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        W &= F_A \cdot \Delta x\\
        W &= (25 \N)(5 \m)\\
        W &= 100 \J
    \end{aligned}
    $$
\end{problem}


\begin{problem}
    \textbf{SEE ATTACHED FIGURE}

    a) How much energy is expended by the applied force to move the couch 5 $\m$?
    b) How much energy does the frictional force expend to move the couch 5 $\m$?

    To solve part a):
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        W_A &= F_{Ax} \cdot \Delta x\\
        W_A &= F\cos\theta \cdot \Delta x\\
        W_A &= (50 \N)\cos(25^\circ)(5 \m)\\
        W_A &= 227 \J
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    To solve part b):
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        W_f &= -F_f \cdot \Delta x\\
        W_f &= -\mu_kF_N \cdot \Delta x\\
        W_f &= -\mu_k(mg + F_A\sin\theta) \cdot \Delta x\\
        W_f &= -(0.15)((20\kg)(9.81\frac{\m}{\s^2}) + (50\N)\sin(25^\circ))
        W_f &= VALUE
    \end{aligned}
    $$

\section{Energy}

Energy comes in many different forms. The main forms of energy (as well as the proofs to get their respective equations) are listed below:


\begin{definition}[Kinetic Energy]{def4.2:label}
    If an object is moving, the energy that the object expends is equal to the \textbf{kinetic energy}. 

    $$
    KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
    $$

    $KE$ = the kinetic energy expended\\
    $m$ = mass of the object\\
    $v$ = velocity of the object at the given moment where you wish to find the energy
\end{definition}

\subsection{The Usefulness of Energy and Work}

While we have an equation for the work if we know the applied forces, if we know other elements about the system (how fast ) [FINISH THIS LATER]

    \end{center}

    While this problem could be solved using kinematics and Newton's second law, we can also use the Work-Energy theorem. 

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        W_{in} &= \Delta KE + \Delta PE\\
        F_T \cdot L &= \frac{1}{2}m(v_f - v_i)^2 + mg(h_f - h_i)\\
        F_T \cdot L &= \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 + mgh_f\\
        v_f &= \sqrt{\frac{2(F_TL - mgh_f)}{m}}\\
        v_f &= \sqrt{\frac{2(F_TL - mg(L\sin\theta))}{m}}
    \end{aligned}
    $$
\end{problem}

    \begin{aligned}
        W_{in} = 0 &= \Delta PE + \Delta E_s + \Delta E_{T}\\
        0 &= mg(h_f-h_i) + \frac{1}{2}k(x_f-x_i)^2 + \mu_kmgD\\
        0 &= -mgh_i + \frac{1}{2}kx_f^2 + \mu_kmgD\\
        x_f &= \sqrt{\frac{(mgh_i-\mu_kmgD)^2}{k}}\\
        x_f &= \sqrt{\frac{((70\kg)(9.81\frac{\m}{\s^2})(50\m)-(0.15)(70\kg)(9.81\frac{\m}{\s^2})(15\m))^2}{150 \frac{\N}{\m}}}\\

\section{Work and Calculus}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Sometimes, the force being applied to an object over a given distance is variable
    \item If you are given an equation for what the force is (dependent on distance), then $W = \int_{x_i}^{x_f} F(x) dx$
\end{itemize}


\begin{problem}
    If the force applied to an object (as a function of distance) is $F(x) = 5 - 2x$, what is the work done on the object if the object moves 3 \m?

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        W &= \int_{x_i}^{x_f} F(x) \: dx\\
        W &= \int_{0}^{3} 5-2x \: dx\\
        W &= (5-2(3))-(5-2(0)) = -1-5
        W &= -6 \J
    \end{aligned}
    $$
\end{problem}


\section{Power}

\begin{definition}[Power]{def4.5:label}
    \textbf{Power:} How much energy is expended over a given time interval.

    $$
    P = \frac{\Delta E}{\Delta t} = \frac{W}{t}
    $$

    \textbf{SI Units:} Watts (W)
\end{definition}


\begin{problem}
    A block of mass 1000 kg is attached to a pulley at the top of a building. The pulley is attached to a motor that uses 200 kW. What is the final velocity of the block the moment it reaches the top of the building?

    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{chapters/ch4/images/fig4_8}
    \end{center}

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        P &= \frac{\Delta E}{\Delta t}\\
        P &= \frac{\Delta KE + \Delta PE}{\Delta t}\\
        P &= \frac{\frac{1}{2}mv^2+mgh}{\Delta t}\\
        v_f &= \sqrt{\frac{2(-mgh+\Delta T P)}{m}}
    \end{aligned}
    $$
\end{problem}


\begin{problem}
    A truck drives up a ramp with an angle of inclination of $15^\circ$. If the truck drives 200 meters in 20 seconds, what is the power of the truck (in kW) after the truck has moved 200 meters? Assume that 10\% of the total energy is lost to the environment.

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        P &= \frac{\Delta E}{t}\\
        P &= \frac{\Delta KE + \Delta PE}{t}+ 10\%\text{ energy}\\
        P &= \frac{\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + mgh}{t} + 10\%\text{ energy}\\
        P &= \left[\frac{\frac{1}{2}m\left(\frac{\Delta x}{t}\right)^2 + mgL\sin\theta}{t}\right]\frac{1}{0.9}\\
        P &= 98.3 \text{ kW}
    \end{aligned}
    $$
\end{problem}


\begin{problem}
    A person with mass 80 kg is on a scooter on top of a hill that is 30 m tall. The person is pushed off by a spring with a spring coefficient of 1500 N/m. The spring is compressed 2.5 m. The person will then go down a hill and launch into the air, then land in a pit of tar with a coefficient of kinetic friction of 0.8. \\

    a) Find the velocity of the person right after the spring pushes him off.\\

    b) Find the distance the person will travel after he lands in the tar. 

    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{chapters/ch4/images/fig4_10.PNG}
    \end{center}

    a)

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        W &= \Delta KE + \Delta E_s\\
        0 &= \frac{1}{2}mv_i^2+\frac{1}{2}k(-x_i)^2\\
        v_i = \sqrt{\frac{kx_i^2}{m}}\\
        v_i = 10.8 \frac{\m}{\s}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    b)
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        W &= -\frac{1}{2}m(v_i)^2 + mg(-h_i) + F_fd\\
        0 &= -\frac{1}{2}mv_i^2 + - mgh_i + \mu_kF_Nd\\
        d &= \frac{mgh_i + \frac{1}{2}mv_i^2}{\mu_kmg}\\
        d &= 44.9 \m
    \end{aligned}
    $$
\end{problem}


\begin{problem}
    A ball with mass 2 kg is placed inside a cannon that is launched using a spring with spring constant 200 N/m. The spring is compressed 2 m and is compressed all the way to the ground (so that $PE_i = 0$). The cannon is at an angle of $20^\circ$. What is the maximum height that the ball is launched?

    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{chapters/ch4/images/fig4_11.PNG}
    \end{center}

    We first need the velocity right when the ball leaves the spring. We can set up a mini Work-Energy problem:
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        W &= \Delta KE + \Delta PE + \Delta E_s\\
        0 &= \frac{1}{2}mv_i^2 + mgL\sin\theta + \frac{1}{2}k(-(L^2))\\
        \frac{1}{2}mv_i^2 &= \frac{1}{2}kL^2 - mgl\sin\theta\\
        v_i &= \sqrt{\frac{2\left(\frac{1}{2}kL^2 - mgl\sin\theta\right)}{m}}
    \end{aligned}
    $$


    Now we can use the x-component of that velocity to get the final velocity in the overall Work-Energy problem.
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        W &= \Delta KE + \Delta PE + \Delta E_s\\
        0 &= \frac{1}{2}mv_x^2 + mgh_f + \frac{1}{2}k(-(x^2))\\
        mgh_f &= \frac{1}{2}mv_x^2 -\frac{1}{2}kx^2\\
        h_f &= \frac{\frac{1}{2}mv_x^2 -\frac{1}{2}kx^2}{mg}
    \end{aligned}
    $$
\end{problem}
