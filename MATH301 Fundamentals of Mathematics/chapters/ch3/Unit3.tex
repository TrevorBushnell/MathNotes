\begin{definition}[Definition of Even and Odd Numbers]{def3.1:label}
    An integer $n$ is \textbf{even} if $n=2k$ for some $k \in \Z$\\

    An integer $n$ is \textbf{odd} if $n=2k+1$ for some $k \in \Z$\\

    Two integers have the same \textbf{parity} if both integers are even/odd, otherwise they have the opposite parity.
