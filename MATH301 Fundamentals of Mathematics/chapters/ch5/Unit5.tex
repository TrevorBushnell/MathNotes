\section{Proof By Contradiction Outline}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Suppose $\sim P$ is true
    \item Therefore $C \wedge \sim C$
    \item $C \wedge \sim C$ must be false so our assumption that $\sim P$ was true must be false
    \item If $\sim P$ is false, then $P$ is true
\end{itemize}

\begin{proposition}{prop5.1.1:label}
    If $a,b,\in\Z$, then $a^2-4b\ne 2$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    Let $a,b,\in\Z$. Suppose $a^2-wb = 2$. then we can write $a^2 = 4b+2=2(2b+1)$. In particular, $a^2$ is even, so $a$ must be even. Since $a$ is even, there is an integer $c$ such that $a=2c$. tHEN $a^2 = 4c^2 = 4b+2$ so $ac^2 = 2b+1$. This is  contradiction since $2c^2$ is even and $2b+1$ is odd. Therefore, by proof by contradiction, we conclude that $a^2-4b \ne 2$.
